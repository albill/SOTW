State of the World Archive

This is an archive of ALL 21 of the WELL's State of the World discussions with Bruce Sterling and Jon Lebkowsky.

The -raw files are simply copy and pasted text files with no repairs from the archives of each year.
the -edited files have had part of the headers of each individual post removed and minor heading markdown added and all broken hyperlinks repaired. (The WELL likes to hard wrap lines mid-link, inserting spaces).
The postprocessing newlines are left as displayed.
